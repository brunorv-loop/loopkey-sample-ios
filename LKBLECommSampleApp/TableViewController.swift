        // Before communicating with the device we must first retrieve its roll count parameter so we can send it to
        // the LoopKey server for authentication. There are two ways of retrieving the roll count. The first option is
        // to use the value transmitted during bluetooth broadcast, which is faster but may be unreliable in scenarios
        // when multiple operations are being performed in a short period of time. This is accomplished by calling the
        // `getRollCount()` method without a callback method.
        //
        // This alternative may be used to speed up server authentication. While with the immediate return value you
        // might make an authentication request, you should wait for the confirmed roll count value, compare both
        // values and, if they are the same, use the authentication you've already received from the server. Otherwise,
        // if the values differ, you should request another authentication from the server with the correct roll count
        // value.
        var rollCount = comm.getRollCount(nil)
        print("Roll count on first try (advertisement): ", rollCount?.hexEncodedString() ?? "(nil)")

        // Other alternative is calling the same method but with a callback function. This will make the mobile device
        // connect to the LoopKey device and get its roll count. Even when a callback is provided, the method
        // immediately returns the roll count value it has from the bluetooth broadcast.
        _ = comm.getRollCount { (retrievedRCOptional) in
            if let rc = retrievedRCOptional {
                print("Roll count on second try (read operation): \(rc.hexEncodedString())")

                }
            }

            // With the roll count value, which is a buffer of arbitrary data, you should ping your backend and make any
            // validations that are necessary. If the user should authenticate, your backend should connect to LoopKey
            // servers with the roll count data and ask for an authorization (Check out the /door/sign endpoint).
            // Our servers will return an authenticated message in the Base64 format, which you should pass along to the
            // LoopKey device.
