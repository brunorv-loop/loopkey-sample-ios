# LoopKey Integration Sample Project

[![Documentation Coverage Badge](https://loopce.github.io/loopkey-sample-ios/badge.svg)](https://loopce.github.io/loopkey-sample-ios/)

This project is a sample of how to integrate the LoopKey BLE communication technology with your iOS project.

## LoopKey

LoopKey provides hardware and software libraries to empower Internet of Things applications. Use our technology
to reduce development cost and bring your product to market faster. This project exemplifies how easy it is to use
LoopKey to authenticate with real-world objects.

If you're interested in learning more about LoopKey, contact us at loopkey@loopkey.com.br.

## Where to start

Check out the `TableViewController.swift` file for a walkthrough of the integration. In order for the project to
compile, you'll need to put our frameworks into the Libraries folder.

If you don't have the LoopKey libraries, contact us at loopkey@loopkey.com.br for more information.
